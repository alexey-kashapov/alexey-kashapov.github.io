        <p> While I was studying my bachelor's degree, I was working on my bachelor thesis in  <a href="http://www.inp.nsk.su/"> Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Novosibirsk, Russia (BINP) </a>.
          The Institute grows scintillation crystals and uses them in the detectors or sells them to some customers, e.g. to Japan.
        </p>
          <p>Before using grown crystals in a detector, it is necessary to be sure that these crystals are not defective.
            For that reason, BINP developed a cross-board for quality control of grown scintillator crystals. You can see this board in picture 1.
            The control unit in this board is System-on-Chip Zynq-7000, which consists of FPGA and CPU with interactive interfaces.
            <br>In the board, FPGA detects very fast events, that occur in crystal while CPU runs web-server allowing an engineer to control the board and get recent data.

          </p>
             <p>My objective was to set up this cross-board; it means to establish an interaction between FPGA and CPU, to create an own image of Linux, to create a firmware design for the FPGA part and to develop a web-server.</p>

                <p>There was a lot of work. Initially, I had no experience in building a Linux image. I knew nothing about Zynq-7000 and its principles.
                  In the end, I got a lot of experience of self-learning and technical skills in web-development, FPGA firmware design, low-level programming skills, and Linux images creating.
