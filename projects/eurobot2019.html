      <h3>Eurobot 2019 contest</h3>
      <p> Eurobot i s a robotic constest. An amazing event gathering fun, high technology, friendship, creativity, education and passion!
        Created in 1998, Eurobot is an international amateur robotics contest open to teams of young people, organized either in student projects or in independent clubs. </p>

      <p> To participate in the competition the team needs to design and make two autonomous robots.
        The robots must complete specific tasks in a minute and 30 seconds and earn maximum points.
        At the same time the team must solve a number of specific tasks and to complete a full cycle of development and production of the robot.‚Äù
        For further information visit: http://www.eurobot.org/ </p>

      <h4>Our team became a Champion of National contest in Russian and become a veci-champion in World Final in La-Rouche-sur-Yon, France!!!</h4>

  <h3>My contribtution</h3>
  <p> I was one of the member of software developers. I focused on computer vision, decision making system and low-level - high-level interaction.
  For speeding up the process of software developing we used ROS as the main framework and developed own packages. All code is available here: https://github.com/SkoltechRobotics/ros-eurobot-2019 </p>

  <h4>CV</h4>
  <p>  We used computer vision system for tracking game objects (pucks) and determing their coordinates and colors. On the first picture you see the original image from the camera, it has a big distortion and it is impossible to detemine coordinates of the pucks from this point of view.
  To solve this task I applied homography transformation, knowing the position of the camera I got the vertical projection and then knowing the template of the field I made one more homography transofrmation based on feature matching.
The next step was to recognize all pucks on the table. Initially, I tried to solve this task using contours approach, finding all contours and thend filtering them by area,prerimetres and etc.
Unfortunately, this method had a huge light conditions sensitivity. It was decided to use deep learning for puck detection. We found U-Net model is lightweight and sufficient for our task. It showed much better result than traditional contours approach.
Here some photos of data collection and labeling.
Thus, we knew how the location of the pucks in pixel domain and we knew the size of the table and the pixel size of the image we can find the pixel/cm ration and find coordintes of pucks relative to the table frame.

  <h4>Desicion making system</h4>
    <p> We developed an own framework for creating decision making systems for our robots. We used the idea of behavior tree, which is cery popular in game devlopment and robotics.
      We tried to make robots behavior robust and created some exceptions handlers for some unexpected events,e.g. if we tried to take game object and we couldn't we tried make it again.   </p>
