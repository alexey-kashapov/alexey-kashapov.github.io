        <p> I joined the WareVision team for a short summer internship and made a big contribution to them.
                In terms of autonomous robotics, I developed a navigation stack for the platform and a behavior tree for the system platform-drone, using ROS for both robots.
                        </p>
                        <p>The video demonstrates my contribution. The platform uses my navigation stack to create trajectory and follow it.
                Morevover, behavior tree which was launched on the platform controls a drone behavior by sending the comands after drone's response.
                As it is a prototype, in that moment on the video we didn't use LIDARs for localization and the platfrom followed the trajectory just by odometry. In the next iteration WareVision will use LIDARs and accessory beacons for localization stack.

                <p>One of the key concepts in this project is a localization system for the drone. Inside the platform locates a camera with IR-filter which absorbs all spectrum light except IR. At the same time there are 5 IR light emitters on the drone form a pattern.
                The platform detects the pattern and can calculate height and an angle of the drone with respect to camera frame.</p>
